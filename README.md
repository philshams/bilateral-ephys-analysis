# bilateral-ephys-analysis
bilateral ephys analysis from Cortex Lab

load_ephys is the primary script from which to run other analysis files.

The 1st cell will create parameters allowing you to load the data from the particular session of interest.
The 2nd cell will load in the experimental and ephys data.
The 3rd cell will load ephys data after it has been processed and saved once, by running the second cell.

Following cells run scripts to analyze stimulus response and correlations across units and hemispheres!
